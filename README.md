# Getting Started Book Store app

In this app you can create, fetch and update a book. It uses API endpoint http://68.178.162.203:8080/application-test-v1.1/books to do that.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs front-end on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm run build`

Builds the front-end app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
